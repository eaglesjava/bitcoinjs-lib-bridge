Any operation of this software will be deemed as that you have read and agree to be bounded by this agreement.</p>     <p class=\"tit\">1. Services Offered</p>     <p>You can use BitBill to create or import the wallet, store any digital asset supported by BitBill, and manage the wallet; multiple wallets can be created by BitBill, and all of them can be used to store several types of digital assets supported by BitBill. Each wallet possesses different ID and varied mnemonic words;</p>     <p>You can transfer your digital assets through receiving function and transferring function of BitBill. It should be noticed that any actual asset transfer is processed on the related blockchain system (rather than on BitBill). You are fully aware the irrevocability of the blockchain-based transaction. You also acknowledge that BitBill cannot suspend or revoke any transferring transaction and so forth. In addition, the transferring action should be confirmed by the password. Provided that you forget the password, you can recover your wallet through the backup mnemonic words to reset your password;</p>     <p>You can use BitBill to add a new contact person who is linked to the wallet ID or address to facilitate the transaction of the digital asset; please backup the recovery key of the contact person. You can recover the contact list by the recovery key;</p>     <p>We would backup part or all of your transaction records through the blockchain system. Nevertheless, the accuracy of transaction record should be subject to the record in the blockchain system.</p>     <p>BitBill recommends you to acquire basic knowledge about digital asset prior to your application of the BitBill software. It is appropriate to use the BitBill wallet as you fully understand the digital asset.</p>     <p class=\"tit\">2. You Own Your Private Keys</p>     <p>Differing from financial institutions in the banking industry, BitBill, inheriting the decentral characteristic of the blockchain, provides a decentralization service to protect the safety of the digital asset of the user. </p>     <p><b>BitBill does not provide following services:</b> saving user’s wallet password and mnemonic words; retrieving user’s password and mnemonic words; freezing the wallet; reporting the loss of wallet; recovering the wallet; performing the transaction rollback. The user shall personally keep his/her all mnemonic words because BitBill does not provide aforementioned services;</p>     <p>You will acknowledge and agree that you cannot access the digital asset in the BitBill wallet, provided that you lose your access to such wallet, and do not backup the relating mnemonic words or lose such backup at the same time. BitBill cannot recover your wallet or retrieve the wallet password or mnemonic words; BitBill does not bear any liability caused by any damage resulting from aforementioned reason.</p>     <p>It should be noticed that any transaction request is irrevocable. Therefore, provided that the user performs an error operation (including but not limited to transferring to the wrong person, wrong address, and input wrong money amount), BitBill cannot revoke any transaction and bear any liability resulting from such error conduct.</p>     <p>Provided that you cannot understand the aforementioned content, BitBill recommends you to fully learn the knowledge about the cryptocurrency prior to the application of BitBill wallet.</p>     <p class=\"tit\">3. User’s Obligation and Liability</p>     <p>The user must be a natural person with full capacity for civil conduct. Provided that you are a juvenile under 18 years old, you shall read and accept the BitBill agreement, and use the BitBill software under the direction of your parent or guardian. Provided that the personal with no capacity for civil conduct uses BitBill, or the person with limited capacity for civil conduct performs a transaction exceeding his/her civil rights or conduct limitation, BitBill would be entitled to require such person and his/her parents or guardian to bear any liability resulting from such operation;</p>     <p>ou shall bear the liability for the digital assets possessed by you;</p>     <p>You shall properly keep your mnemonic words and the recovery key of the contact person;</p>     <p>You shall assure the accuracy of the contact person as you add a new contact person in case of any irreparable damage caused by any irrevocable transaction;</p>     <p>You shall assure that any operation of BitBill is subject to Australian laws;</p>     <p>You shall not store the digital asset to the address unsupported by BitBill;</p>     <p>Any operation of yours shall not disturb other users or numeral functioning of BitBill’s servers, including excessive application of API and spam email;</p>     <p>Any operation of yours relating to the BitBill should not violate Australian laws and your local laws;</p>     <p class=\"tit\">4. No Control Over Blockchains</p>     <p>Regarding any digital asset supported by BitBill, it is not created and cannot be controlled by BitBill. You shall bear full liability for your choice and operation relating to the digital asset.</p>     <p class=\"tit\">5. Integration of Third-party Application</p>     <p>BitBill may integrate third-party applications. Despite that BitBill may facilitate your access to the integrated third-party application, BitBill does not bear any liability resulting from your operation of such third-party application. You should contact the third-party organization provided that you need any help.</p>     <p class=\"tit\">6. Transactions</p>     <p>Effective blockchain transaction is only formed by the digital asset transaction actually recorded on the blockchain.</p>     <p>BitBill may allow you to send the directive for digital asset transaction. Nevertheless,  BitBill cannot guarantee that such transaction through BitBill would be actually stored on the blockchain. You must assure that your transaction is subject to the application rules of BitBill software, (especially for smart contract system such as ETH).</p>     <p>BitBill does not have any service charge for the moment.Other agreement or rules will be issued provided that BitBill charges any service in the future.</p>     <p>Certain transaction operation may occur transaction fee (such as mining fee), which depends on the requirement of the digital asset possessed by you.
